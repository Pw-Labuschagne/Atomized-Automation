Atomized Automation.


This is my portfolio project for my ALX_Software_Engineering course.

I Have to say that this has not been a joke. If you were to consider it please just remeber that when the required time is stipulated on the program, it is mwant to be followed. If you can accesss the deep knowledge which has been taught in this course then, I believe that you can accomplish what has been set out by you ( the next gen of SE).

The journey so far( Supernatural fan much?):

#1. The project and aproval state is not something you need to take lightly. If you were to set out a goal then ensure that it is aligned with the time allocated to that specified by yourself in the task. For  me it was a great time to think of the future potential. Eversince I can remember I wanted to be a game developer, so obviously I chose The path of creating a game with little-to-no knowledge/experience in this field( Please, Scrath does not apply). I had not made the requirements for this tasks which I have set out to do, so I'm laggingg in/t time delay( No ladies and gents it's nor jet-lag nor packet loss ect..). ( I'll continue this blog when needed).
